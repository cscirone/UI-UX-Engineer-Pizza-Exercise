## Research and Insights

As detailed by the user stories, the users of the application will be the store owner, and workers. 

The application should be user friendly and will be used to create pizza orders and build out individual pizzas.

It should be assumed that the application will be running on computers and tablet devices, as those are the most likely devices to be used in a restaurant establishment. However, a responsive design will ensure that the application will still display properly on devices of any size.

One assumption that is clear is that duplicate toppings are not allowed. So simply not allowing for the possibility, by making topping selection radio buttons or checkboxes will satisfy this requirement. For example, size selection should be radio buttons, as only one size is allowed to be selected. But for something like meat selection, checkboxes should be used to allow the selection of multiple meats without allowing for the possibility of duplicate meat selection.
